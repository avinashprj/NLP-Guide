## Build a twitter sentiment analysis tool

Create a github repo & clone it locally use gitbash

```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

open this folder in vscode & open a new terminal(powershell)

```bash
  code .

```

create a virtual environment for your project. Pls make sure you have installed virtualenv

```bash

virtualenv env_name

env_name\Scripts\activate
  
```
Download and upload the requirements.txt file from this repo to your folder. Now install the dependencies

```bash
  wget -O requirements.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prathikshetty2002/NLP-Guide/main/requirements.txt

  pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Create an app.py file in vscode and do the below steps

```bash
import streamlit as st

st.title('Hello world!')
